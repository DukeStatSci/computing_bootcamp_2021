## Before you get started

In order to actively follow along you have a few options.

- Use a docker container from Duke OIT

    1. Go to https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers
    2. Log in with your Duke NetID and password
    3. Find `Jupyter - interactive data science and scientific computing notebooks`
    4. Click the link to create your environment
    
- Get Python and Jupyter notebook for your own computer

    1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
    2. Download Python 3.x version based on your OS
    3. Follow install instructions at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
    
- Use RStudio with R Markdown (run Python, but no Jupyter notebook)

    1. Log in to the DSS RStudio server
    2. In an R Markdown file you can insert Python chunks instead of R chunks
    3. Click the dropdown arrow next to insert

# Jupyter notebook

---

## Overview of the notebook

Bimodal interface: edit mode and command mode

&lt;br&gt;

Click in a cell or hit `enter` to enter edit mode
.center[
![](images/edit-mode.png)
]

When in edit mode you can type code or write text with markdown.

&lt;br&gt;

Hit `esc` to enter command mode
.center[
![](images/command_mode.png)
]

When in command mode you can make edits to the notebook, but not individual
cells.

---

## Notebook shortcuts

In **edit** mode:

- Run cell and add new cell: `shift + enter`
- Add a line within a cell: `enter`

--

In **command** mode:

- Save the notebook: `s`
- Change cell to markdown: `m`
- Change cell to code: `y`
- Cut, copy, paste, delete a cell: `x`, `c`, `v`, `d`
- Add a cell above, below: `a`, `b`

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The point-and-click interface is also an option to execute these commands.

---

## Jupyter notebook versus R Markdown

- Similar to R Markdown, Jupyter notebooks allow you to write code and text in
  one easy to read document that is reproducible and easy to share with others.

- A Jupyter notebook does not knit to an HTML, PDF or Word file. However, you
  can embed HTML into a notebook.

- For a more detailed comparison see 
  [The First Notebook War](https://yihui.name/en/2018/09/notebook-war/).

## Arithmetic operators

Python supports the standard arithmetic operations.

.pull-left[

```python
10 + 8
```

```
18
```

```python
3 - 2
```

```
1
```

```python
100 / 6
```

```
16.666666666666668
```

```python
80 * 0
```

```
0
```
]

.pull-right[

```python
100 // 3 # integer division
```

```
33
```

```python
13 % 4   # modulo operator
```

```
1
```

```python
4 ** 3   # raise to power
```

```
64
```
]

&lt;br/&gt;

*No need to worry about the difference between `int` and `float`.*

---

## Comparison operators


```python
5 &gt; 0
```

```
True
```

```python
4 &lt; 100
```

```
True
```

```python
3 == 3 # equality
```

```
True
```

```python
10 &lt;= (5 * 1.9)
```

```
False
```

```python
0 != 1 # not equal
```

```
True
```

---

Use boolean key words `and`, `or`, and `not` for multiple comparisons.


```python
(5 &gt; 10) or (8 / 2 == 4)
```

```
True
```

```python
True and (8 &gt; 64 ** 0.5)
```

```
False
```

```python
not True and (8 &gt; 64 ** 0.5)
```

```
False
```

```python
not (True and (8 &gt; 64 ** 0.5))
```

```
True
```

Parentheses matter. Also, python is case sensitive. True != TRUE unless 
you set a variable TRUE = True which is something you probably shouldn't do.

Operators `&amp;`, `|`, and `^` are bitwise operators; you probably will not need
them. However, these operators are used in R, so try not to get confused.

---

## Python versus R

Key differences in operators in Python versus R.

&lt;br/&gt;

| Operator purpose |  Python |        R                |
|-----------------:|:-------:|:-----------------------:|
|             true |  `True` |  `TRUE`,  `T`           |
|            false | `False` | `FALSE`,  `F`           |
|               or |   `or`  | `\(\vert\)`,  `\(\vert \vert\)` |
|              and |  `and`  |       `&amp;`, `&amp;&amp;`         |
|              not |  `not`  |       `!`               |
|           modulo |   `%`   |      `%%`               |
|   exponentiation |   `**`  |       `^`               |
| integer division |   `//`  |      `%/%`              |

---

## Object assignment

Use a single `=` for object assignment.


```python
a = 10
a
```

```
10
```

```python
b = [-10, 0, "computing", "bootcamp", 5 / 2]
b
```

```
[-10, 0, 'computing', 'bootcamp', 2.5]
```

```python
my_string = "This is a longgggg string"
my_string
```

```
'This is a longgggg string'
```

```python
nums = list(range(7))
nums
```

```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

---

## Shortcut operation and assignment

Unlike R, Python supports things like


```python
a = 5
a += 3
a
```

```
8
```


```python
val = 10
val **= 3
val
```

```
1000
```

These are equivalent to `a = a + 3` and `val = val ** 3`, respectively.

# Data types and structures

---

## Built-in data structures

Python has four primary built-in data structures.

- **List**: an ordered collection of mutable items

- **Tuple**: an immutable list

- **Dictionary**: an unordered collection of key-value pairs

- **Set**: an unordered collection of unique objects

&lt;br/&gt;

These data structures will generally consist of **integers**, 
**floating point** numbers, **strings**, or **booleans**. 
Using the function `type()` will identify
the data type or structure. 

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

*Hit `p` while viewing the HTML slides for an exhaustive
table of the built-in python data types and structures.*

???

| Data type / structure | Python characterization            |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Text Type:            | `str`                              |
| Numeric Types:        | `int`, `float`, `complex`          |
| Sequence Types:       | `list`, `tuple`, `range`           |
| Mapping Type:         | `dict`                             |
| Set Types:            | `set`, `frozenset`                 |
| Boolean Type:         | `bool`                             |
| Binary Types:         | `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview` |

---

## Lists

- Lists are ordered sequences that can contain a variety of objects, even
  other lists.
  
- A pair of `[` `]` can be used to create a list with each component separated
  by a comma.

- The first item in a list is considered to be in position 0, not position 1.


```python
my_list = [9, [1, 1, 1], 10, "swimming", "hiking"]
my_list
```

```
[9, [1, 1, 1], 10, 'swimming', 'hiking']
```

.pull-left[

Indexing


```python
my_list[0]
```

```
9
```

```python
my_list[-1] 
```

```
'hiking'
```
]

.pull-right[

Slicing `start:stop:step`


```python
my_list[1:3]
```

```
[[1, 1, 1], 10]
```

```python
my_list[1:4:2]
```

```
[[1, 1, 1], 'swimming']
```
]

---

## Tuples

- Tuples are similar to lists except that they are immutable. You won't be able
  to reassign something once it exists in a tuple.

- A pair of `(` `)` can be used to create a tuple. Each component is separated
  by a comma.


```python
cars = ("subaru", "bmw", "hond", "ford")
cars[3]
```

```
'ford'
```

--

If we try to fix the typo in `cars`, we get


```python
cars[2] = "honda"
```

`TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment`

---

## Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is 
  connected to a value. The value can be any object you can create in Python.

- Syntax: `{"key_1": value_1, "key_2": value_2}`


```python
my_bike = {"model": "trek", "style": "gravel"}
```

--

Subset based on a key


```python
my_bike["model"]
```

```
'trek'
```

--

Add a dictionary entry


```python
my_bike["year"] = 2020
my_bike
```

```
{'model': 'trek', 'style': 'gravel', 'year': 2020}
```

---

## Sets

- Sets are an unordered collection of unique objects that can be created with
  a pair of `{` `}`, where each entry is separated by a comma.

- Test for membership and apply set operators that you know from set theory.




```python
my_set = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
my_set
```

```
{'a', 'c', 'd', 'b'}
```

--


```python
list("seewhathappens")
```

```
['s', 'e', 'e', 'w', 'h', 'a', 't', 'h', 'a', 'p', 'p', 'e', 'n', 's']
```

```python
my_set2 = set(list("aabbbbbbbbcddddddde"))
my_set2
```

```
{'c', 'd', 'e', 'b', 'a'}
```

# Classes, methods, attributes

---

## A brief introduction to OOP

Python is an object oriented programming (OOP) language. Objects can be
categorized by their class type. For each class, there exists a collection of
methods and attributes.

- Methods can be thought of as functions defined for a specific class.

- Attributes can be thought of as variables defined for use with respect to a 
  class.

- To access methods and attributes, type `my_object.&lt;method or attribute&gt;`,
  where after the `.` is the selected method or attribute.

---

## Methods in action


```python
my_courses = ["STA523", "STA199", "STA521", "STA601"]
type(my_courses)
```

```
&lt;class 'list'&gt;
```

--


```python
my_courses.append("STA323") # add on an element
my_courses
```

```
['STA523', 'STA199', 'STA521', 'STA601', 'STA323']
```

--


```python
my_courses.reverse() # change the order
my_courses
```

```
['STA323', 'STA601', 'STA521', 'STA199', 'STA523']
```

--


```python
my_courses.pop() # remove last element
```

```
'STA523'
```

```python
my_courses
```

```
['STA323', 'STA601', 'STA521', 'STA199']
```

---

## Attributes in action


```python
x = 4 + 3j
y = 0 + 1J

[x.real, y. real]
```

```
[4.0, 0.0]
```

```python
[x.imag, y.imag]
```

```
[3.0, 1.0]
```

&lt;br/&gt;

Methods are called similar to functions with `()`; attributes are called similar
to a variable or object. Typing `.` and hitting tab will populate the available
methods and attributes for a given object.

---

## More methods in action


```python
my_string = "python is an object oriented programming language"
```

--


```python
my_string.title() # title case
```

```
'Python Is An Object Oriented Programming Language'
```

```python
my_string.count("o") # count the "o"s
```

```
4
```

--


```python
z = (6, 0, 11, 99, -5, 0, 0)
```

--


```python
z.index(11) # find position of 11
```

```
2
```

```python
z.count(0)  # count the 0s
```

```
3
```

---

## Exercises

1. Create a float variable and each of the four built-in data structures
   discussed (list, tuple, dictionary, set). For each object, use a combination
   of two methods or attributes and document in markdown their functionality.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
2. Set object `dilemma`, given below, to all lowercase. Then, reverse the 
   order of the letters. Lastly, capitalize the first "b".
    
    ```python
    dilemma = "Borrow OR Rob"
    ```
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
*Hint:* `dilemma[start:end:step]`. What does a negative index do?

# Control flow

---

## `if`, `for`, `while`

- The syntax style of control flow in Python is based off `:` and indentations.
  Python does not wrap code blocks for control flow with `{ }` as is
  done in R.

- There is no `switch` statement and no `repeat` statement in Python.

---

## `if`

Syntax:

.small[

```python
if condition:
  # code block
  # indented
elif another_condition:
  # code block
  # indented
else:
  # code block
  # indented
```
]

--
&lt;br/&gt;

Example:

.small[

```python
medical_cost = 180

if medical_cost &lt;= 100:
  bill = medical_cost
elif medical_cost &lt;= 200:
  bill = 100 + (0.5 * (medical_cost - 100))
else:
  bill = 150
  
print("Your total bill is {} dollars.".format(bill))
```

```
Your total bill is 140.0 dollars.
```
]

---

## `for` loop

Syntax:


```python
for index in sequence:
  # code to be
  # iterated
  # again, indented
```

--
&lt;br/&gt;

Example:


```python
j = 1
for i in "Duke":
  print("Letter {index} is {letter}.\n".format(index = j, letter = i))
  j += 1
```

```
Letter 1 is D.

Letter 2 is u.

Letter 3 is k.

Letter 4 is e.
```

---

Some more `for` loop examples...


```python
squares = []
for i in range(1, 11):
  squares.append(i ** 2)
  
squares
```

```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

--


```python
d = {"language": "python", "version": 3.7, 
     "year": 1989, "creator": "Guido van Rossum"}
      
for k, v in d.items():
  print("The key is {}, and its value is {}.".format(k, v))
```

```
The key is language, and its value is python.
The key is version, and its value is 3.7.
The key is year, and its value is 1989.
The key is creator, and its value is Guido van Rossum.
```

---

## `while` loop

Syntax:

.small[

```python
while condition:
  # code to be
  # iterated
  # again, indented
```
]

--
&lt;br/&gt;

Example:

.small[

```python
j = 100
i = 1.01
while i &lt; j:
  i *= i
  print(round(i, 2))
```

```
1.02
1.04
1.08
1.17
1.37
1.89
3.57
12.77
163.13
```
]

---

Some more `while` loop examples...


```python
nums = list(range(3))
while nums:
  num_off = nums.pop()
  print("The number {} was removed from the list nums.".format(num_off))
```

```
The number 2 was removed from the list nums.
The number 1 was removed from the list nums.
The number 0 was removed from the list nums.
```

--

Python supports `break` statements.


```python
my_string = "I'm sleepy, "
i = 1
while True:
  my_string += "z"
  i += 1
  if i &gt; 10:
    break
    
my_string
```

```
"I'm sleepy, zzzzzzzzzz"
```

# Functions

---

## Defining a function

As with control flow, Python relies on indentations and `:` for function style
syntax as opposed to `{ }` in R.

.small.pull-left[

```python
def func_name(arg1, arg2):
    """
    Docstring starts with a 
    short description.

    May have more 
    information here.

    arg1 = something
    arg2 = something

    Returns something

    Example usage:

    func_name(1, 2)
    
    """
    
    result = arg1 + arg2

    return result
```
]

.small.pull-right[

```python

## Exercises

    
    
    

1. Write a function that takes a list and returns a list of the
   unique elements of the inputted list in descending order. Do this without 
   using `set()`.
    
    ```python
    unique_list([1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5])
    ```
    
    ```
    [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    ```
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
2. Write a function that counts the number of
   prime numbers less than or equal to a specified number.
    
    ```python
    prime_count(k = 13)
    ```
    
    ```
    6

## Importing

A module is a single importable Python file whereas a package is made up of 
two or more modules. Both can be imported the same way with the keyword
`import`.

For example, `import math` imports the math module and provides access to
its many functions.


```python
import math
math.factorial(5)
```

```
120
```

```python
math.sqrt(100)
```

```
10.0
```

```python
math.log(1)
```

```
0.0
```

## Importing `from`

If you don't want to import all the functions from a module, you can
just import the ones you need with the keyword `from`.



```python
from math import factorial, sqrt, log
factorial(5)
```

```
120
```

```python
sqrt(100)
```

```
10.0
```

```python
log(1)
```

```
0.0
```


This technique eliminates the need to preface each function call with `math.`.

---

## Importing `from`

You can import all functions from a given module by using the `*` operator.
For example,


```python
from math import *
```

imports all the functions from the `math` module.

However, this is a bad idea as you may have conflicts between your 
object names and function names in the module.

---

## Importing `as`

For brevity, people often give an alias to a package or module on import. This
can be done with the keyword `as`. For example,


```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Thus, rather than type `matplotlib.pyplot.hist()` a user can type `plt.hist()`. 
There are common conventions for aliases so stick to using those.

---

## Example

Import packages / modules:


```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

In Jupyter notebook you'll want to include the below line of code in a cell
to allow for inline plotting.


```python
%matplotlib inline
```

---

Let's plot a heatmap based on a 20 by 20 grid of random numbers.


```python
data = np.random.rand(20, 20)
heat = plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()
```

&lt;img src="02_python_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-59-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Example

Create a histogram based off of 5000 randomly generated standard normal
variables.


```python
norm_rv = st.norm.rvs(loc = 0,scale = 1, size = 5000)
n, bins, patches = plt.hist(x = norm_rv, bins = 20, alpha = .5, color = "purple",
          edgecolor = "black", linewidth = 1.2)
plt.show()
```

&lt;img src="02_python_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-60-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Exercises

1. Create a histogram based off of random variables generated from a probability
   distribution of your choice.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
2. Plot 100 time steps of a simple symmetric random walk that starts at the 
   value 0.
